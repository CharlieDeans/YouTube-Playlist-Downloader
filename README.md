# WELCOME TO THE YouTube Playlist Downloader

The use of this program is quite simple. Make sure you've got Python installed. Preferably the newest.  
-Run setup.py to install your requirements or use  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-pip install -r requirements.txt'  
-Run get_videos.py to start the process.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-It will ask for a YouTube playlist link. Copy your link and paste it into the CLI.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-It will then create a 'video.json' file when just has all of the video links.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Then it will download all of the videos as MP4 and convert them into MP3s  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(yes i'm aware this is stupid but it works so unless  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you want to fix it, it's staying like this)
